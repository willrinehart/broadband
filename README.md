# Empirical research on broadband

My continuing research on broadband will live in [this repo](https://github.com/willrinehart). Notebooks in this series:

* [Broadband adoption and use analysis](https://github.com/willrinehart/broadband/blob/main/simple_analysis.md) 

Michael Kotrous put all of his data in this [repo](https://github.com/michaelkotrous/form477-panels/), which supports his academic work in broadband. *Highly suggested*.
